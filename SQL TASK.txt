Sale Table:
sale id, sales date , user email

SaleProducts Table :
product id, sale id, product name , price , quantity, category(men/women/kids) , size, color


I want to see report of list of sales with fields :
user email, sale date, sale total (how much the user needs to pay)
the condition -
the total sold - for category women only- is bigger than the average that was sold in this category.


SELECT S.user_email, S.sale_date, SP.SALE_TOTAL
FROM Sale S
INNER JOIN
(
SELECT sale id,
SUM(price*quantity) AS SALE_TOTAL
FROM SaleProducts
WHERE category = 'women'
GROUP BY sale id
) SP ON S.sale_id = SP.sale_id
WHERE SP.SALE_TOTAL > AVG(SALE_TOTAL)
